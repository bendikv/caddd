CADDD (the three D's represent 3D) aims to be a 3D open source cross platform CAD system.  It is currently in its infancy.  Building block programs will be hosted here to aid in the journey to the final product.

Update:
The bulk of all required technologies have been integrated together in <a href='http://www.caddd.org/2010/04/opencascade-12-hours-from-zero-to-hero.html'>The OpenCASCADE Challenge!</a> Feel free to download and try it out.
